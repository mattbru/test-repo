# LREM - Local Reference Electrification Model

LREM is an adaptation of REM \(Reference Electrification Model\) for local electrification planning.  LREM seeks to aid developers in making viable decisions regarding microgrid design by providing the analytics needed to conduct technical and financial explorations

## Inputs required for LREM

- Geographic coordinates of demand nodes
- The consumer type of each node
- Demand inputs for each type of consumer
- Hourly PV insolation data
- Hourly temperature data
- Discount rate
- A generation catalog
- A network catalog

## Outputs of LREM

- The optimal generation mix
- Estimates of operational performance
- The distribution network design
- Financial estimates

## Generalized Workflow of LREM

1. Inputs and settings building
2. Generation Investment
3. Network Design
4. Results Output
